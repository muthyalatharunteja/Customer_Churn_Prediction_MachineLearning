# Customer_Churn_Prediction_MachineLearning
End-to-end ML project simulating a production workflow. Conducted EDA to analyze churn behavior, engineered and scaled features, trained and tuned multiple models using GridSearchCV, selected the best model, and deployed it via Streamlit for real-time predictions.
